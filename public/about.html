    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      As a professional frontend developer, I pride myself on my ability to
      craft engaging and user-friendly experiences on the web. With a keen eye
      for design and a deep understanding of modern web technologies, I strive
      to create seamless interfaces that captivate users and enhance their
      online interactions.

    <p>
      One of my key strengths lies in my proficiency with HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScriptâ€”the foundational building blocks of frontend development. I
      leverage these technologies to translate design mockups and wireframes
      into fully functional web pages, ensuring pixel-perfect accuracy and
      responsive design across various devices and screen sizes.
